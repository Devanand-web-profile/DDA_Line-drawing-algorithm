# DDA_Line-drawing-algorithm
DDA stands for Digital Differential Analyzer. It is an incremental method of scan conversion of line. In this method calculation is performed at each step but by using results of previous steps.  Suppose at step i, the pixels is (xi,yi)  The line of equation for step i               yi=mxi+b......................equation 1  Next value will be               yi+1=mxi+1+b.................equation 2               m =DDA Algorithm               yi+1-yi=∆y.......................equation 3               yi+1-xi=∆x......................equation 4               yi+1=yi+∆y               ∆y=m∆x               yi+1=yi+m∆x               ∆x=∆y/m               xi+1=xi+∆x               xi+1=xi+∆y/m    Case1: When |M|&lt;1 then (assume that x12)               x= x1,y=y1 set ∆x=1               yi+1=y1+m,     x=x+1               Until x = x2  Case2: When |M|&lt;1 then (assume that y12)               x= x1,y=y1 set ∆y=1               xi+1=DDA Algorithm,     y=y+1               Until y → y2
